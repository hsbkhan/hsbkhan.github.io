<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>  Born and raised in Pakistan, I came to the states back in 2014. I love it here, however, I do visit Pakistan at least once a year. Just moved from Morgantown, WV to Charlotte. I'm new to the city.   </li>
<li><strong>Professional Backgroud:</strong> Graduated with a bachelors degree in Petroleum Engineering from WVU. I am an international student. Got some work experience in Petroleum Engineering. </li>
<li><strong>Academic Background: </strong>My early school up to high school was in Pakistan. I came to the United States in 2014, started here as a freshman at WVU. I graduated in 2018. Here I am back at it again at CPCC.  </li>
<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 7, 8 and 10 (oh, and Vista) at home and school. </li>
<li><strong>Courses I'm taking and why:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>WEB110</strong> - Internet/Web Fundamentals - This class what I am most excited about because I've always wanted to learn how to make websites and search engines. <a href = "contract.html">WEB110 Course Contract </a> </li>
<li><strong>CSC143</strong> - Object oriented Programming - Programming is vital to IT and this course is perfect to introduce different types of programming methods.</li>
<li><strong>CTS115</strong> - Information Systems Business Concepts - IT plays a key role in managing business and this course offers immense potential in managing and understanding major technological components in business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Something to remember me by:</strong> I am a college graduate but my degree seems to be dying out so I decided to come back to the basics and therefore I am now working towards becoming a software developer. </li>
